# Analyze International Debt Statistics

#### Remark:
This is a learning project from Datacamp called "Analyze International Debt Statistics".

The project can't be viewed by people who do not belong to the Datacamp platform, for this reason in this activity you will find the notebook without the database.

You can see the project's description I submitted in the following [link](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/1906).

### Background

Humans not only take debts to manage necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries.

### Project description

In this project, international debt data collected by The World Bank will be analyzed. The dataset includes information on the amounts of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across various categories. The analysis aims to identify the countries with the highest and lowest levels of debt using data manipulation skills.
